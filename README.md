## Solution to Lup Engineering Test

* NOTE: Upon examination of the supplied build scripts, I could not find a way to push to the remote build environment or any useable connection strings for Azure TableStorage.

* Therefore have setup for default use of the local Azure Storage Emulator.

* Pushed to non-`master` branch to avoid indexing.

* Tested with Chrome, Postman, Azure Storage Explorer and integration tests. A greate candidate project for extensive integration and unit tests but ran out of time!
